2. What would you do to increase this limit ?

Firsly I will find part of  code is responsible for allocating the most memory. In other words
which objects occupy large portions of heap where these objects are being allocated in source code






3. Is your program efficient ?

No, because it is using sequential search ,
It checks each element in sequence until the desired element is found or the list is exhausted

I would use  comparison utilities for exampl Eugene Myer's An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations
